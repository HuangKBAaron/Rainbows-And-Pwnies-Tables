markov files are ascii files with the following format

        model_size
<-------------------------->
[first character occurences]
[key character 0][following character occurences]
[key character 1][following character occurences]
                 <------------------------------>
                             model_size

lines are separated by '\n' ONLY

model_size must be a power of 2

character occurences are strings of characters that the markov engine can
choose from when picking a character for that location

for example, for first character occurences, if we had:

AAAABBCD

Our model could choose A,B,C or D. Because AAAA appears 4 times, our model
will pick A half the time.

If the frequence of characters following B was A*3, C*3, B*1 D*1 we would have
a line that looked like this:
BAAACCCBD
